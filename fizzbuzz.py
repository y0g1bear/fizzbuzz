Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

We will use a variation of this test in which the last number of the series isn't necessarily 100, and the two numbers being tested for multiples aren't necessarily three and five. For example, your program should behave just like this:

How many numbers shall we print? 25
For multiples of what number shall we print 'Fizz'? 3
For multiples of what number shall we print 'Buzz'? 5
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
